# Combining Selectors

## Element with Class Selector
```css
p.big {
    font-size: 20px;
}
```
Every p that has class = 'big'
Note the lack of space between element and class definition.

Example:
```html
<p class="big">This will get text size as 20px</p> 
<div class="big">Unaffected text</div> 
```

## Child Selector
```css
article > p {
    color: blue;
}
```
Every p that is a direct child of article.
We read it from right to left
Example:
```html
<article>
    <p>This will have blue text</p> 
</article>
<p>Unaffected text</p>
<article>
    ...
    <div>
        <p>unaffected text. Since this is not a direct child</p>
    </div>
</article>
```

## Descendant Selector
```css
article p {
    color: blue;
}
```
Just like before, we read it from right to left.
Every p that is inside (at any level) of article
Example:
```html
<article>
    <p>Blue text</p>
</article>
<p>Unaffected Text</p>
<article>
    <div>
        <p>Blue Text</p>
    </div>
</article>
```

## Not limited to Element Selectors
Example:
```css
.colored p {
    color: blue;
}

article > .colored {
    color: blue;
}
```
Here, in our first style, Every p that is inside (at any level) an element with class = "colored"
In second example, Every element with class="colored" that is a direct child of article element
