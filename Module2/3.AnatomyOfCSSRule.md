# Anatomy of CSS Rule

Selector p
Declaration: 'color: blue'. Declaration is property 
and value.
property and value is separated by : and ended by a semicolon
Semicolon is not required but used in best practices

p {
    color: blue;
}

Another example with several declarations:
p {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 20px;
    width: 200px;
}

Collection of the css rules is called a stylesheet (SS)
h1 {
    color: green;
    font-size: 36px;
    text-align: center;
}

Empty stylesheet is a valid stylesheet.
