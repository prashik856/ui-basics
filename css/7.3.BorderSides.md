# CSS Border Sides

## CSS Border - Individual Sides

From the examples on the previous pages, you have seen that it is possible to specify a different border for each side.

In CSS, there are also properties for specifying each of the borders (top, right, bottom, and left):
```css
p {
  border-top-style: dotted;
  border-right-style: solid;
  border-bottom-style: dotted;
  border-left-style: solid;
}
```

The example above gives the same result as this:
```css
p {
  border-style: dotted solid;
}
```

So, here is how it works:
If the border-style property has four values:
```
    border-style: dotted solid double dashed;
        top border is dotted
        right border is solid
        bottom border is double
        left border is dashed
```

If the border-style property has three values:
```
    border-style: dotted solid double;
        top border is dotted
        right and left borders are solid
        bottom border is double
```

If the border-style property has two values:
```
    border-style: dotted solid;
        top and bottom borders are dotted
        right and left borders are solid
```

If the border-style property has one value:
```
    border-style: dotted;
        all four borders are dotted

```

```css
 /* Four values */
p {
  border-style: dotted solid double dashed;
}

/* Three values */
p {
  border-style: dotted solid double;
}

/* Two values */
p {
  border-style: dotted solid;
}

/* One value */
p {
  border-style: dotted;
} 
```

The border-style property is used in the example above. However, it also works with border-width and border-color.
