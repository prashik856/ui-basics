# CSS Comments

CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code.

## CSS Comments
Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.

Comments are ignored by browsers.
```
A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */:
```

```css
 /* This is a single-line comment */
p {
  color: red;
} 
```

You can add comments wherever you want in the code:
```css
p {
  color: red;  /* Set text color to red */
}
```

Even in the middle of a code line:
```css
p {
  color: /*red*/blue; 
}
```

Comments can also span multiple lines: 
```css
/* This is
a multi-line
comment */

p {
  color: red;
}
```

## HTML and CSS Comments
From the HTML tutorial, you learned that you can add comments to your HTML source by using the <!--...--> syntax.

In the following example, we use a combination of HTML and CSS comments:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
p {
  color: red; /* Set text color to red */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>My Heading</h2>

<!-- These paragraphs will be red -->
<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>This paragraph is styled with CSS.</p>
<p>CSS comments are not shown in the output.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
