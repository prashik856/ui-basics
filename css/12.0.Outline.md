# Outline

An outline is a line drawn outside the element's border.

## CSS Outline
An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, OUTSIDE the borders, to make the element "stand out".

CSS has the following outline properties:

```
    outline-style
    outline-color
    outline-width
    outline-offset
    outline
```

Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.

## CSS Outline Style
The outline-style property specifies the style of the outline, and can have one of the following values:
```
    dotted - Defines a dotted outline
    dashed - Defines a dashed outline
    solid - Defines a solid outline
    double - Defines a double outline
    groove - Defines a 3D grooved outline
    ridge - Defines a 3D ridged outline
    inset - Defines a 3D inset outline
    outset - Defines a 3D outset outline
    none - Defines no outline
    hidden - Defines a hidden outline
```

The following example shows the different outline-style values:
Demonstration of the different outline styles:

p.dotted {outline-style: dotted;}
p.dashed {outline-style: dashed;}
p.solid {outline-style: solid;}
p.double {outline-style: double;}
p.groove {outline-style: groove;}
p.ridge {outline-style: ridge;}
p.inset {outline-style: inset;}
p.outset {outline-style: outset;}
```
