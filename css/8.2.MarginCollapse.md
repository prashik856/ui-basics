# Margin Collapse

Sometimes two margins collapse into a single margin.

## Margin Collapse
Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.

This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins!

Demonstration of margin collapse: 
```css
h1 {
  margin: 0 0 50px 0;
}

h2 {
  margin: 20px 0 0 0;
}
```

```
In the example above, the <h1> element has a bottom margin of 50px and the <h2> element has a top margin set to 20px.

Common sense would seem to suggest that the vertical margin between the <h1> and the <h2> would be a total of 70px (50px + 20px). But due to margin collapse, the actual margin ends up being 50px.
