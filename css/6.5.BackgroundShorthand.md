# CSS Background Shorthand

## CSS background - Shorthand property
To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property.

Instead of writing:
```css
body {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
}
```

You can use the shorthand property background:
Use the shorthand property to set the background properties in one declaration:
```css
body {
  background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;
}
```

When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:
```
    background-color
    background-image
    background-repeat
    background-attachment
    background-position
```

It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order. Note that we do not use the background-attachment property in the examples above, as it does not have a value.
