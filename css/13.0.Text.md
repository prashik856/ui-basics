# CSS Text

CSS has a lot of properties for formatting text.

## Text Color
The color property is used to set the color of the text. The color is specified by:
```
    a color name - like "red"
    a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
    an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"
```

Look at CSS Color Values for a complete list of possible color values.

The default text color for a page is defined in the body selector.

```css
body {
  color: blue;
}

h1 {
  color: green;
}
```

## Text Color and Background Color
In this example, we define both the background-color property and the color property:
```css
body {
  background-color: lightgrey;
  color: blue;
}

h1 {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}

div {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
```

High contrast is very important for people with vision problems. So, always ensure that the contrast between the text color and the background color (or background image) is good!
