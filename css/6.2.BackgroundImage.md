# CSS Background Image

## CSS background-image
The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.

By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.

Set the background image for a page: 
```css
body {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
}
```

This example shows a bad combination of text and background image. The text is hardly readable: 
```css
body {
  background-image: url("bgdesert.jpg");
}
```

When using a background image, use an image that does not disturb the text.

```
The background image can also be set for specific elements, like the <p> element:
