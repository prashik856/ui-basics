      Let's link to a Facebook Fan page I created for this course!
      <!-- link to Facebook page WITH TARGET-->
<!--      Only difference from internal link is that here, the href value has full http link-->
<!--      Since external links has a their own DNS-->
<!--      Target Attribute: "_black", forces browser to open a link into a new tab. This is very useful in that regard. -->
