# HTML content model

## Block Level Elements and Inline Elements

Block Level Elements
- Render to begin on a new line (by default)
- May contain inline or other block-level elements
- Roughly Flow Content (html5 category)

Inline Elements
- Render on the same line (by default)
- May only contain other inline elements
- Roughly Phrasing Content (html5 category)

html5 replaces these definitions with more complex set 
of content categories.
However, this distinction remains practical because it 
aligns well with existing CSS rules.
