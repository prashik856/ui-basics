  <h1>Internal Links</h1>
  <section>
    We can link to a file in the same directory as this HTML file like this:
<!--    The way we can create a link. href stands for hypertext reference.-->
<!--    Since no directory is provided, browser will assume file is present in the same directory-->
<!--    Good to always provide title attribute to a tag. The content in the a tag will be shown as a link-->
    <a href="11.same-directory.html" title="same dir link">Linking to a file in the same directory</a>

<!--    In this example, this div tag will be our content of our link-->
<!--    a tag is a inline element. Here we are using a block level element inside an inline element.-->
<!--    But a tag is both Flow content and Phrasing. So, this tag is both inline element and a block element.-->
    <a href="11.same-directory.html" title="same dir link">
      <div> DIV Linking to a file in the same directory</div>
