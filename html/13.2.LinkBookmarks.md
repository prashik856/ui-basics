# Link Bookmarks

HTML links can be used to create bookmarks, so that readers can jump to specific parts of a web page.

## Create a Bookmark in HTML
Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long.

To create a bookmark - first create the bookmark, then add a link to it.

When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the bookmark.

First, use the id attribute to create a bookmark:
```html
<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
```

Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:
```html
 <a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a> 
```

You can also add a link to a bookmark on another page:
```html
<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
```

## Chapter Summary
```
    Use the id attribute (id="value") to define bookmarks in a page
    Use the href attribute (href="#value") to link to the bookmark
```
