# Computer Code

HTML contains several elements for defining user input and computer code. 

```html
 <code>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
</code> 
```

## HTML <kbd> For Keyboard Input
```
The HTML <kbd> element is used to define keyboard input. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.
```

```html
 <p>Save the document by pressing <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd></p> 
```

## HTML <samp> For Program Output
```
The HTML <samp> element is used to define sample output from a computer program. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.
```

```html
 <p>Message from my computer:</p>
<p><samp>File not found.<br>Press F1 to continue</samp></p> 
```

## HTML <code> For Computer Code
```
The HTML <code> element  is used to define a piece of computer code. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.
```

Example
```html
 <code>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
</code> 
```

```
Notice that the <code> element does not preserve extra whitespace and line-breaks.

To fix this, you can put the <code> element inside a <pre> element:
```

```html
 <pre>
<code>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
</code>
</pre> 
```

## HTML <var> For Variables
```
The HTML <var> element  is used to define a variable in programming or in a mathematical expression. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
```

```html
 <p>The area of a triangle is: 1/2 x <var>b</var> x <var>h</var>, where <var>b</var> is the base, and <var>h</var> is the vertical height.</p> 
```
