# Symbols

Symbols or letters that are not present on your keyboard can be added to HTML using entities.

## HTML Symbol Entities
HTML entities were described in the previous chapter.

Many mathematical, technical, and currency symbols, are not present on a normal keyboard.

To add such symbols to an HTML page, you can use the entity name or the entity number (a decimal or a hexadecimal reference) for the symbol:

```html
 <p>I will display &euro;</p>
<p>I will display &#8364;</p>
<p>I will display &#x20AC;</p> 
```
