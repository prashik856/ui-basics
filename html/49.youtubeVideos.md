# Youtube Videos

The easiest way to play videos in HTML, is to use YouTube.

## Struggling with Video Formats?
Converting videos to different formats can be difficult and time-consuming.

An easier solution is to let YouTube play the videos in your web page.

## YouTube Video Id
YouTube will display an id (like tgbNymZ7vqY), when you save (or play) a video.

You can use this id, and refer to your video in the HTML code.

## Playing a YouTube Video in HTML
To play your video on a web page, do the following:
```
    Upload the video to YouTube
    Take a note of the video id
    Define an <iframe> element in your web page
    Let the src attribute point to the video URL
    Use the width and height attributes to specify the dimension of the player
    Add any other parameters to the URL (see below)

```
```html
 <iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY">
</iframe> 
```

## YouTube Autoplay + Mute
You can let your video start playing automatically when a user visits the page, by adding autoplay=1 to the YouTube URL. However, automatically starting a video is annoying for your visitors!

Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed.

Add mute=1 after autoplay=1 to let your video start playing automatically (but muted).

```html
 <iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY?autoplay=1&mute=1">
</iframe> 
```

## YouTube Playlist
A comma separated list of videos to play (in addition to the original URL).

## YouTube Loop
Add loop=1 to let your video loop forever.

Value 0 (default): The video will play only once.

Value 1: The video will loop (forever).

```html
 <iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY?playlist=tgbNymZ7vqY&loop=1">
</iframe> 
```

## YouTube Controls
Add controls=0 to not display controls in the video player.

Value 0: Player controls does not display.

Value 1 (default): Player controls display.
```html
 <iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY?controls=0">
</iframe> 
```
