# Elements

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

## HTML Elements
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
```html
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
```

Examples of some HTML elements:
```html
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p> 
```

HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
