# HTML vs XHTML

XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML.

## What is XHTML?
```

    XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language
    XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML
    XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application
    XHTML is supported by all major browsers

```

## Why XHTML?
XML is a markup language where all documents must be marked up correctly (be "well-formed").

XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats (such as XML). In addition, browsers ignore errors in HTML pages, and try to display the website even if it has some errors in the markup. So XHTML comes with a much stricter error handling.

## The Most Important Differences from HTML
```

    <!DOCTYPE> is mandatory
    The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory
    <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory
    Elements must always be properly nested
    Elements must always be closed
    Elements must always be in lowercase
    Attribute names must always be in lowercase
    Attribute values must always be quoted
    Attribute minimization is forbidden

```

## XHTML - <!DOCTYPE ....> Is Mandatory
```
An XHTML document must have an XHTML <!DOCTYPE> declaration.

The <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> elements must also be present, and the xmlns attribute in <html> must specify the xml namespace for the document.
```

```xhtml
 <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
  <title>Title of document</title>
</head>
<body>

  some content here...

</body>
</html> 
```

## XHTML Elements Must be Properly Nested

```xhtml
 <b><i>Some text</i></b> 
```

## XHTML Elements Must Always be Closed
