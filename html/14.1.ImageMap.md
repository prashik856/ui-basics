# Image Map

With HTML image maps, you can create clickable areas on an image.

## Image Maps
```
The HTML <map> tag defines an image map. 
An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags. 
```

```html
 <img src="mac.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">

<map name="workmap">
  <area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="computer.htm">
  <area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" href="phone.htm">
  <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Coffee" href="coffee.htm">
</map> 
```


## How Does it Work?
The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click.

To create an image map you need an image, and some HTML code that describes the clickable areas.

## The Image
```
The image is inserted using the <img> tag. The only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute:
```
```html
<img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">
```

The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.

You can use any image as an image map!

## Create Image Map
```
Then, add a <map> element.

The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute:
```

```html
<map name="workmap">
```

The name attribute must have the same value as the <img>'s usemap attribute .

## The Areas
Then, add the clickable areas.

```
A clickable area is defined using an <area> element.
```
