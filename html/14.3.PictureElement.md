# The Picture Element
```
The HTML <picture> element allows you to display different pictures for different devices or screen sizes.
```

## The HTML <picture> Element
```
The HTML <picture> element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.

The <picture> element contains one or more <source> elements, each referring to different images through the srcset attribute. This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device.

Each <source> element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable.
```

Note
```
Always specify an <img> element as the last child element of the <picture> element. The <img> element is used by browsers that do not support the <picture> element, or if none of the <source> tags match.
```

## When to use the Picture Element
```
There are two main purposes for the <picture> element:
```

### Bandwidth
```
If you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large image file. The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any of the following elements.
```

### Format Support
```
Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. By using the <picture> element, you can add images of all formats, and the browser will use the first format it recognizes, and ignore any of the following elements. 
```

```html
 <picture>
  <source srcset="img_avatar.png">
  <source srcset="img_girl.jpg">
  <img src="img_beatles.gif" alt="Beatles" style="width:auto;">
</picture> 
```

```
The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any following <source> elements.
```

```
<img> 	Defines an image
<map> 	Defines an image map
<area> 	Defines a clickable area inside an image map
<picture> 	Defines a container for multiple image resources
```
