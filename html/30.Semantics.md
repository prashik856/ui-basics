# Semantics

Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

## What are Semantic Elements?
```
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
```

## Semantic Elements in HTML
```
Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  
```

```html
    <article>
    <aside>
    <details>
    <figcaption>
    <figure>
    <footer>
    <header>
    <main>
    <mark>
    <nav>
    <section>
    <summary>
    <time>
```

## HTML <section> Element
```
The <section> element defines a section in a document.

According to W3C's HTML documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."

Examples of where a <section> element can be used:

    Chapters
    Introduction
    News items
    Contact information

A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.
```

```html
 <section>
<h1>WWF</h1>
<p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international organization working on issues regarding the conservation, research and restoration of the environment, formerly named the World Wildlife Fund. WWF was founded in 1961.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h1>WWF's Panda symbol</h1>
<p>The Panda has become the symbol of WWF. The well-known panda logo of WWF originated from a panda named Chi Chi that was transferred from the Beijing Zoo to the London Zoo in the same year of the establishment of WWF.</p>
</section> 
```

## HTML <article> Element
```
The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.

Examples of where the <article> element can be used:

    Forum posts
    Blog posts
    User comments
    Product cards
    Newspaper articles

```

```html
 <article>
<h2>Google Chrome</h2>
<p>Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google, released in 2008. Chrome is the world's most popular web browser today!</p>
</article>

<article>
<h2>Mozilla Firefox</h2>
<p>Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser developed by Mozilla. Firefox has been the second most popular web browser since January, 2018.</p>
</article>

<article>
<h2>Microsoft Edge</h2>
<p>Microsoft Edge is a web browser developed by Microsoft, released in 2015. Microsoft Edge replaced Internet Explorer.</p>
</article> 
```

## Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa?
```
The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

The <section> element defines section in a document.

Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot!

So, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> elements, and <article> elements containing <section> elements.
```

## HTML <header> Element
```
The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

A <header> element typically contains:

    one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
    logo or icon
    authorship information

Note: You can have several <header> elements in one HTML document. However, <header> cannot be placed within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element.
```

```html
 <article>
  <header>
    <h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1>
    <p>WWF's mission:</p>
  </header>
  <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment,
  and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p>
</article> 
```

# HTML <footer> Element
```
The <footer> element defines a footer for a document or section.

A <footer> element typically contains:

    authorship information
    copyright information
    contact information
    sitemap
    back to top links
    related documents

You can have several <footer> elements in one document.
```


```html
 <footer>
  <p>Author: Hege Refsnes</p>
  <p><a href="mailto:hege@example.com">hege@example.com</a></p>
</footer> 
```

## HTML <nav> Element
```
The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links.


Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links.

Browsers, such as screen readers for disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content.

```

```html
 <nav>
  <a href="/html/">HTML</a> |
  <a href="/css/">CSS</a> |
  <a href="/js/">JavaScript</a> |
  <a href="/jquery/">jQuery</a>
</nav> 
```
