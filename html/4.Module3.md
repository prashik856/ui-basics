# History

## History till now
How we got to html5?

Before 1997, Not driven by Standards

In 1997, HTML 4.0 and 4.01 came up with some stand protocols. (World Wide Web Consortium)

XHTML 1.0 in 2000.

WHATWG: HTML in 2004. Web Hypertext Application Technology Group.

In 2007, WHATWG & W3C start to work together.

2011, we have html5.

## What matters to us?
W3C and WhatWG are two major companies. 
W3C is responsible for html5. 
WhatWg is responsible for html (evolving).
