# Anatomy of html tag

'<p>' -> Opening
'</p>' -> Closing tag
p -> Element name
Contenat -> contenant inside opening and closing tag

<br> -> Line break
<hr> -> Horizontal Rule
They don't have closing tag

<p id="myId" ></p>
Every element can have a predefined attribute
Here, id is an attribute
myId - Attribute value
This is metadata of the tag
id has to be unique in entire html document.
If id is same, it can break the html document.

<p id="differentId"></p>
No space is allowed between < and p. It has to be <p.
Same goes for closing bracket.
It has to be </. 
It can be </ p>, but cannot be < /p>.
Must have space between p and attribute id.
Space is allowed everywhere else.

Attributes can only be specified on opening tag.

## Value of attribute
surround value of attribute between single or double quotes.
' and " are same in html.

But the opening and closing quotes needs to be same.
onclick="alert('hi')" -> good
onclick="alert('hi')' -> bad

We can next quotes as well.

## Self closing tag
Example - <p/>
We can also provide it like this:
<p></p> -> opening and closing tag with no content in it.
