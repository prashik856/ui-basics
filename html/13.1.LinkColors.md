# Link Colors

An HTML link is displayed in a different color depending on whether it has been visited, is unvisited, or is active.

## HTML Link Colors
By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):
```
    An unvisited link is underlined and blue
    A visited link is underlined and purple
    An active link is underlined and red
```

You can change the link state colors, by using CSS:

Here, an unvisited link will be green with no underline. 
A visited link will be pink with no underline. 
An active link will be yellow and underlined. 
In addition, when mousing over a link (a:hover) it will become red and underlined:

```html
<style>
a:link {
  color: green;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:visited {
  color: pink;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
  color: red;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

a:active {
  color: yellow;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
</style> 
```

## Link Buttons
