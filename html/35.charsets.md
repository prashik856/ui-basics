# Charsets

To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set to use.

## The HTML charset Attribute
``
The character set is specified in the <meta> tag:
```

```html
 <meta charset="UTF-8"> 
```

The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set.

UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!

## The ASCII Character Set
ASCII was the first character encoding standard for the web. It defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet:
```
    English letters (A-Z)
    Numbers (0-9)
    Special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < >.
```

## The ANSI Character Set
ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set:
```
    Identical to ASCII for the first 127 characters
    Special characters from 128 to 159
    Identical to UTF-8 from 160 to 255
```

```html

<meta charset="Windows-1252">

```

## The ISO-8859-1 Character Set
