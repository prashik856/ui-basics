# Page Title

Every web page should have a page title to describe the meaning of the page.

```
The <title> element adds a title to your page:
```

```html
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>HTML Tutorial</title>
</head>
<body>

The content of the document......

</body>
</html> 
```

The title should describe the content and the meaning of the page.

The page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO). The text is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.
```
The <title> element:

    defines a title in the browser toolbar
    provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
    displays a title for the page in search engine-results
```

## HTML Title Tag
```
