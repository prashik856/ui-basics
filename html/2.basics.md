# Basics

## HTML Documents
```
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>. 
```

## The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
```
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:
```
```html

<!DOCTYPE html>

```

## HTML Headings
```
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: 
```

## HTML Paragraphs
```
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:
```

```html
 <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p> 
```

## HTML Links
```
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:
```

```html
 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a> 
```

The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 

Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

You will learn more about attributes in a later chapter.

## HTML Images
```
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:
```

```html
 <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142"> 
```
